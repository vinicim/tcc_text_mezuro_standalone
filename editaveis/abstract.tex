\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english} 
  
This work presents a study and our collaboration on a source code monitoring platform called Mezuro. This platform is developed through an open source project. At the first moment, It was designed as Noosfero plugin, a social networking platform.
%
However, with successive changes, increase of size and features, Mezuro also have increased its complexity. The Mezuro development team have had problems to control its maintainability.
%
This undergraduate work, we are discussing the main reasons and motivations to migrate Mezuro to a standalone platform, according to the Mezuro development analysis, as well as we discuss the impacts of that change on Mezuro architecture and its quality requirements.
%
We also present a report of our collaboration on that free software project.
